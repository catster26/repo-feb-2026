<h1>Stand By You</h1>
<p>Even if we can't find heaven, heaven, heaven<br />
Heaven, heaven, heaven</p>
<p>Hands, put your empty hands in mine<br />
And scars, show me all the scars you hide<br />
And hey, if your wings are broken<br />
Please take mine 'til yours can open too<br />
'Cause I'm gonna stand by you</p>
<p>And oh, tears make kaleidoscopes in your eyes<br />
And hurt, I know you're hurting, but so am I<br />
And love, if your wings are broken<br />
Borrow mine so yours can open too</p>
<p>'Cause I'm gonna stand by you<br />
Even if we're breaking down (hey)<br />
We can find a way to break through<br />
Even if we can't find heaven<br />
I'll walk through hell with you<br />
Love, you're not alone<br />
'Cause I'm gonna stand by you<p>
